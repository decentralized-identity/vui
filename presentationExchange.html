    <h2 id="subtitle">Definition of the standards allowing a presentation exchange between a wallet and a verifier of
        any technology provider under the Verifier Universal Interface protocol, as well as its relations with other
        protocols in VUI.
    </h2>

    <section id="abstract">
        <p>
            Decentralized digital identity, or "self-sovereign" identity (SSI), is a new paradigm proposed for managing
            digital identities. Relying on Decentralized identifiers (<a>DIDs</a>) and Verifiable Credentials (VC), the
            subject
            and his personal credentials are independent from any centralized registry,
            identity provider, or certificate authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the Decentralized Identity model, the role associated to requesting and verifying credentials is
            defined as the Verifier.
        </p>
        <dd>
            In order to retrieve those credentials in an interporative way, a standard exchange protocol supporting all
            the needs of wallet providers and verifiers providers is required. As there are multiple interoperability
            and standarization efforts present, the goal of this spec is to build upon the existing protocols and
            explain its usage by any verifier and it's relation with other possible verifier needs.
        </dd>

        <p class="ednote">
            Despite its format, this document doesn't aim to be publish on the W3C as a standard normative, rather to
            propose extensions of existing protocols to allow to connect them with other interfaces or add additional
            features.
            Those extensions must be discussed and included if considered deemed on said protocols.

        <h1>Context</h1>
        <p>
            There are multiple known and well adopted technology solutions or standard focused on the presentation
            exchange between a wallet and a verifier. There are framework solutions, such as <a
                href="https://github.com/hyperledger/aries"> Hyperledger Aries</a>.
            And there are also other standardization efforts, that might be compatible or not with other solutions, such
            as:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href="https://identity.foundation/DIDcomm-messaging/spec/">DID Comm</a>, which is
                supported
                by <a href="https://identity.foundation/waci-presentation-exchange/">WACI</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/credential-handler-api/">CHAPI</a>
            </li>

                <a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/vc-api/">VC-HTTP-APIS</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="
                    https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html">DID
                    SIOP</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            It seems however that the [DIF Presentation Exchange] Data Model is a well accepted starting point, as it is
            the base or supported by most of those listed approaches.

            However, a few extensions of the data models are suggested to allow the usage of <a>Data Agremeents</a> and
