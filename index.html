    <h1 id="title">Verifier Universal Interface</h1>
    <h2 id="subtitle">Definition of the standards and interfaces that might be consumed by any verifier to be
        interoperable with any wallet</h2>

    <section id="abstract">
        <p>
            Decentralized digital identity, or "self-sovereign" identity (SSI), is a new paradigm proposed for managing
            digital identities. Relying on Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VC), the subject
            and his personal credentials are independent from any centralized registry,
            identity provider, or certificate authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the Decentralized Identity model, the role associated to requesting and verifying credentials is
            defined as the Verifier.
        </p>
        <dd>
            The verifier functionality is to support the data collector as it tries to acquire credentials from some
            other party for the purpose of negotiating a business transaction. It does so by creating presentation
            requests (or Presentation Definition as it is called in the draft DIF specfication for Presentation
            Exchange) that ask for such credentials, sending them to a holder component of another party, receiving
            a
            response to such a request (which we call a 'presentation'), verifying the presentation, i.e. checking
            the
            signature and other proofs of the veracity of both the construction of the presentation as well as its
            contents, thus providing the party with verified data.

        </dd>

        <p>
            This document specifies the interfaces that MAY be consumed by any verifier allowing him to be interoperable
            with any wallet fulfilling this interface, regardless of:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The vendor of the technology
            </li>
            <li>
                The technology stack used
            </li>
            <li>
                The SSI governance framework in use
            </li>
        </ul>

        </p>

            Despite its format, this document does not aim to be published on the W3C as a standard normative, rather it aims to
            propose a universal interfaces for a verifier. However, this format is however extremely adequate to allow work
            and contribution
            on the protocol definition.

        <h1>Context</h1>
        <p>
            As different technology providers are offering SSI solutions, it becomes increasingly relevant to ensure
            interoperability between them. On a not yet stable market, most providers aim to offer the whole
            SSI stack: components for holders, verifiers, issuers and did-resolver.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to avoid vendor lock-ins, the APIs exploited by the Verifiers component can be standarized. This
            document aims to offer the necessary capabilities for a Verifier component of a technology provider to
            use the technology stack of another SSI provider.

            This document presents an overview of all the different interfaces covered by the Verifier Universal
            Interface working group. It refers to each of their specs and tries to provide (if needed) additional
            information on how they relate.

                Registries of Issuers and Credential Schemas MAY be separated and managed by different entities.
                Multiple registries of Issuers and/or Schemas MAY be queried by a Verifier.
            </p>
            <p>
                Verifiers MAY make use of internal private registries to complement the public registries.
                Defining a protocol to merge different registries is outside the scope of this document.

            <p>
                Verifiers MAY query and assign different levels of trust to different governance platforms, but all the
                platforms should present the same query interface.

            <p>
                Registries SHALL be publicly available and auditable. Persisting registries on DLTs is OPTIONAL but
                RECOMMENDED as good practice in order to maintain neutrality.
            </p>
            <p>
                Registries MUST offer a web interface. REST protocol SHOULD be employed with HTTP Method GET and
                JSON formatting as default.
