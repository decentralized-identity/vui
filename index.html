            Decentralized digital identity, or "self-sovereign" identity (SSI), is a new paradigm proposed for managing
            digital identities. Relying on Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VC), the subject
            and his personal credentials are independent from any centralized registry,
            identity provider, or certificate authority.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the Decentralized Identity model, the role associated to requesting and verifying credentials is
            defined as the Verifier.
        </p>
        <dd>
            The verifier functionality is to support the data collector as it tries to acquire credentials from some
            other party for the purpose of negotiating a business transaction. It does so by creating presentation
            requests (or Presentation Definition as it is called in the draft DIF specfication for Presentation
            Exchange) that ask for such credentials, sending them to a holder component of another party, receiving
            a
            response to such a request (which we call a 'presentation'), verifying the presentation, i.e. checking
            the
            signature and other proofs of the veracity of both the construction of the presentation as well as its
            contents, thus providing the party with verified data.

            This document specifies the algorithms, protocols and guidelines to be implemented by any Verifier willing
            to provide SSI functions.

            Despite its format, this document doesn't aim to be publish on the W3C as a standard normative, rather to
            propose an open verifier protocol. This format is however extremely adequate to allow to work and contribute
            on the protocol definition.

        <p>
            As different technology providers are offering SSI Solutions, it becomes a relevant matter to ensure
            interoperability between those providers. On a not yet stable market, most providers aim to offer the whole
            SSI stack: components for holders, verifiers, issuers and did-resolver.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to avoid vendor lock-ins, the APIs exploited by the Verifiers component can be standarized. This
            document aims to offer the sufficient capabilities for a Verifier component of some technology provider to
            use the technology stack of another SSI provider.

        <p>
            Registries managed by the Identity platform governance are needed to:
        <ol>
            <li>
                Discover the credentials available on the Identity platform
            </li>
            <li>
                Manage the format of every credential
            </li>
            <li>
                Stablish the relation between different credentials, taken as attributes to build more complex
                credentials
            </li>
            <li>
                Define and restrict the entities enabled to assert and validate the information from the subjects
            </li>
            <li>
                Assign different levels of trust to the identity validation processes
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            Registries of Issuers and Credential Schemas MAY be separated and managed by different entities.
            Multiple registries of Issuers and/or Schemas MAY be queried by a Verifier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Verifiers MAY make use of internal private registries to complement the public registries.
            Defining a protocol to merge different registries is outside the scope of this document.
        </p>
        <p>
            Registries SHALL be publicly available and auditable. Persisting registries on DLTs is OPTIONAL but
            RECOMMENDED as good practice in order to maintain neutrality.

                During an unique process of asserting the Subject's identity it MAY be possible to assert
                several of the attributes of his identity. Thus, as multiple claims can be stablished from a

                structures, defined as Credential Groups.
                Credential Groups represent a set of monoclaim credentials bound together in order to build a
                more complex credential. All those credentials MUST be considered as belonging to the same
                credential, and their lifecycle managed uniquely.

                    * Level 2: His phone company could assert the possesion of the phone number associated.

            eIDas assigns 4 different levels of trust to the data. This model offers a simpler and different approach,

        <p>
            A same entity could have different Trust levels on the assertion of different credentials
        </p>
        <pre class="example json" title="Example of Issuer Levels for the same Issuer">
                A bank entity could be:

        <p>
            The trust level of a credential process should apply to credential groups, as the process of asserting
            identity claims usually applies to complex credentials with more than one claim.

        <h2>Presentation Exchange</h2>
        <p>
            The presentation exchange is the protocol of communication between the Verifier and the Holder to retrieve
            Verifiable Credentials.
        </p>
        <p>
            The presentation exchange consists on a two step process:
        <ol>
            <li>
                The Holder retrieves a Presentation Request from the verifier.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Holder provides a Presentation Response, containing one or more verifiable presentations to the
                verifier.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>
            Obtaining the Presentation Request
        </h3>
        <p>
            A Presentation Exchange takes place when a Service Provider, connected to a Verifier, needs to retrieve
            Verifiable Credentials from an end user. The user subject MAY store his credentials on a wallet Holder,
            either on the same or a different User-Agent and device than the Service Provider.
        </p>
        <p>
            To access the Holder on any device, the Verifier MUST offer the user a deep link to retrieve the verifiable
            presentation.
        <section data-dfn-for="Deep Link" class="informative">
            <h3>DeepLink</h3>
            <p>
                The deep link MUST use an unique protocol definition: <b>did://</b>. Wallets on different user-agents
                MAY register to listen to that protocol. The protocol MUST NOT be the same as other existing protocols,
                even authentication protocols such as <b>openid://</b>, as presentation exchanges cover several use
                cases apart from authentication.
            </p>

            <h4>Deep Link format</h4>
            <p>

            For presentation exchanges, the deep link should have the following properties:

                Consider delegating services to allow static deep links
            </p>

            <p class="ednote">
                The format of this deep link is for the moment a suggestion. The definition of the deep link protocol
                may be outside the scope of this document.
            </p>
        </section>

        In order to obtain the presentation request, the Verifier should detect the device of the subject compared to
        the expected Holder and offer two different behaviours:
        <ul>
            <li>
                If same device: trigger the Deep Link and redirect the user to the Holder application.
            </li>
            <li>
                If different device: display a QR to allow breaking the channel. The QR MUST contain the same deeplink
                to allow any QR Reading applications on the Holder's device to redirect to the Holders Wallet.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="ednote">
            Other technologies apart from QRs could be used to connect different devices: Bluetooth, Zigbee, NFC
            technologies... QRs have been chosen as a standard for simplicity and technical availability on the current
            user technical capacities. The same process of sharing just the generated Deep Link should work
            independently on the channel chose.

        </figure>
        <p class="note">
            Displaying JWT with Deep Links on QRs might result on very big QRs, resulting on qrs difficult to ready or
            display and lowering user experience. Therefore the use of URIs is RECOMMENDED when displaying QRs.

                The presentation request is a JSON-LD Document to provide a fine-grain definition of which claims are

                information.
                Claims are mapped to the available Credential Types on the catalog, representing all the possible

                    <p>
                        <p>Wallet Authentication is required to ensure that the wallet holding the credentials is actually a secure environment, by identifying uniquely the wallet on which the Presentation Response has been generated.</p>
                        <p>Auditing Credential Wallets from different providers SHOULD be required to ensure an acceptable level of integrity on managing the data.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Wallet Authentication relies on assigning a DID to the wallet application. The corresponding private key to the DID MUST be securely embedded inside the Wallet Application.
                        <p>
                            If a Presentation Request requires a <b>Wallet Authentication</b> Security Mechanism, then on presentation response, a WalletAuthentication object MUST be present with the two properties:

                                    The Private part of the key is stored on the Wallet's secure storage. To retrieve the private part from the wallet, the Subject MUST perform an authentication process, such as receiving an OTP or inputing his biometry.

                        The process of building a digital identity should be implemented by linking a growing number of proved claims to a single identifier. However, it is possible for a single subject to possess multiple DIDs -for instance on multiple SSI platforms-.
                        Being able to trace and assert the relation of various DIDs to a single subject is an authentication need outside the scope of this document.

        <h3>Enforcing Consent</h3>
        <p>
            Presentation responses MUST be signed with a PairWise DID with the same Id of the Verifiable Consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Verifier MUST possess a consent with the ID of a Pairwise DID before receiving a Presentation Response signed by that DID.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Verifier receiving a <a href="#presentation-response"></a> from a Pairwise DID from which he does not possess the consent MUST NOT be able to assert the relation between the Subject of the credentials and the signer of the presentation.
            Those presentations MUST then be considered invalid.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
            Intercepting, inspecting or receiving one or more Presentation Responses is not a valid proof of relation between a Holder and a Verifier without access to the Verifiable Consent.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consents SHALL be modified or revoked by any of the two parties. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>Consent Exchange Protocol</h3>
        <p>
            Upon receiving a Presentation Request from a Verifier from which no previous relation has been stablished, before generating the presentation response, it is the duty of the Holder to create a new Verifiable Consent based on both:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Credential Requests stated by the Verifier
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Verifiable Credentials selected by the Holder
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Verifiable Consent must the be signed twice by the Holder, first with the Pairwise DID and then the Anywise DID.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Consent MUST then be sent to the Verifier domain stated on the Presentation Request.
            The sharing of the message SHOULD be done using an HTTP POST request to the specific path <b>/api/v1/consents</b>.
            <pre class="http">
                <code class="http">
                    POST /api/v1/consents HTTP/1.1
                    Host: $presentationRequest.callback
                    Content-Type: application/json

                    {
                        //Verifiable consent ...
                    }
                </code>
            </pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            The Verifier MUST respond either:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        With the same Consent signed with his DID
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With a 400 error if detecting an invalid process.
                    </li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Only after having received and stored a consent signed by the Verifier SHALL the Holder respond to the Presentation Request with a Presentation Response.
